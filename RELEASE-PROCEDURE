Release procedures
__________________

This is just a brief outline as to how releases and project updates will work.

In terms of releases alone, the main pinybot releases will be based on its "MAJOR" version revisions e.g.
2.0.0 or 3.0.0 etc. In all these releases there will an executable released alongside it
as it is an official release and can be used without fear of particular bugs/issues.

The "MINOR" revisions will still be committed to the project and this will feature new modules/add-ons
and essential fixes to larger bugs which cannot simply be fixed via a "PATCH".

The patches themselves will be released on a maintenance basis.Whenever there are protocol changes or
if there are smaller code revisions or simple fixes we have to change a patch will be pushed to the
repository appropriately.

In addition to all of these details, the project is usually updated after a major update to the base
(pinylib project).
